#+TITLE: IdM --- technical documentation

This documents the /squelette/ of the website at
http://images.math.cnrs.fr/ and complements the documentation there
(which is mainly addressed at article authors and editors --- this one
is full of SPIP ang PHP and geek stuff).

* Features added to SPIP
*** Visible
***** Refereeing support
***** Billettistes
***** Planning
***** MathJax
***** Video and sound
*** In the backgroung
***** E-mail notification of teams
***** LaTeX export

* Code management
This is done in Git, and there are 4 branches to keep track of (plus
temporary ones for experimental features, if needed). That can change if
we end up working in a team but so far:
- =spip3= is tracking the SVN version of the SPIP core (without
  extensions). This is not expected to work, because the extensions
  are not part of that tree and so far the bare SPIP core is not self
  sufficient.
- =upstream= incorporates the extensions, and merges =spip3=
  periodically (meaning whenever a bug is fixed there). It should do both
  at the same time, meaning that a =spip3/upstream= merge is an
  "official" SPIP snapshot.
- =idm= is the current status of the website, with the IdM template,
  and merges =upstream= when needed
- =test= is for development of new but "easy" features, and is typically
  merged into =idm= the same day

* Issues
*** Urgent
- Allow for several articles per referee [0%]
  - [ ] Do not free a referee completely when an article is published
*** In progress
- Podcasts
- Merge =div.plan= and =div.lexique=
- Overhaul of the search engine [33%]
  - [X] Accents, this is done by SPIP3
  - [ ] Sort, classify etc by theme
  - [ ] Automatic article suggestion
- iPhone version [33%]
  - [X] Basic iphone.html
  - [ ] Specific style for small screens (it used to work using
    =max-width=, but apparently that breaks older browsers ...)
  - [ ] Find a way to make login etc. possible
*** Next
- CC per article
- Loop videos
- Upgrade Mathjax [66%]
  - [X] Wait for label/ref to be in mainline mathjax
  - [X] Wait for it to be in a stable release (2.0-beta is rather stable)
  - [ ] Remove the previous hack
- Choose the member in the billets team differently
- =squelettes/propose.html=
  - Add an anchor to the forum messages for linking
- =squelettes/navigation.html=
  - should be re-done completely
- re-install =forms_et_tables= (3.0, doesn't work yet)
*** Backburner
- Buttons to write to groups of people
- Filter display by color, possibly merge with ?date=-1year
- Article validator to test various things [0%]
  - [ ] Accents
  - [ ] Links
  - [ ] Divs
- Floating picture
- Relecteur occasionnel
- Translation encouragement
- Unify the permissions
- Put =#SPIP_CRON= on specific pages but not on =sommaire.html=
- Use =#HTTP_HEADER= rather than php in =inc/head.php=
- Merge =inc/forum-message= and =inc/forum-message-prive=
- In =formulaires/relecteurs_vote.php=, the SQL update code should be
  elsewhere, the rest should go
*** Geekeries and SPIPeries
- In a loop, =#_parent:TITRE=
- Files which are patched versions of upstream (store as a patch for upgrades)
  - =.htaccess= (from =htaccess.txt=)
  - =formulaires/inc-forum_previsu.html=
- Use the =|unique= filter instead of doing it by hand
  - =squelettes/iphone.html=
  - =squelettes/lexique.html=
- Use language strings as much as possible (transfer in passing)
