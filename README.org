* SPIP 3 related
*** Still to do
- re-install forms_et_tables (3.0, doesn't work yet)
*** Files to re-write some day
***** formulaires/relecteurs_vote.php
- the SQL update code should be elsewhere, the rest should go
***** squelettes/navigation.html
- should be re-done completely
***** squelettes/propose.html
- Add an anchor to the forum messages for linking
***** prive/squelettes/contenu/idm_relecteur.html
- Make the relecteur an "objet Ã©ditorial" ?
*** Files which are patched versions of upstream (store as a patch for upgrades)
- .htaccess (from htaccess.txt)
- formulaires/inc-forum_previsu.html
- prive/objets/infos/article.html
* SPIP 3 transition checklist
*** Essential
***** Upload the 'spip3' branch to the server (to test: import the live db instead)
***** Visit the /ecrire/ and upgrade the database
***** Visit the plugins page and activate everything
***** Re-attach the 'champs_extras'
- articles/credits_logo
- auteurs/affiliation
***** Check the GD2 / iMagick configuration
*** Clean up
***** Fields that are safe to delete
- articles/extra
- auteurs/extra
- auteurs/relecteur_*
- breves/extra
- mots/extra
- rubriques/extra
- syndic/extra
